<H2>Project Title : Price Prediction for the Indian Automobile Market</H2>
<p>In 2020, India was the fifth-largest auto market, with ~3.49 million units combined sold in the passenger and commercial vehicles categories. It was the seventh largest manufacturer of commercial vehicles in 2020. The 4-Wheeler Industry in India was ranked fourth (taking over Germany) and is expected to take surpass Japan by the end of 2021.<br>
Nearly 4 million units of four wheeler vehicles were sold in the year 2020 and are expected to grow at a rapid pace. Automobile export grew at a rapid rate of 14.5% during FY 20 in India.</p>
<p>With such a lucrative environment for growth and opportunity, it is natural for international players to setup their foundations in India and profit from this huge economy.</p>
<p>My project is aimed to solve the challenging and complex problem of pricing in the Indian Automobile Industry.With around 1500 model variants floating in the Indian Market, it is essential to get the pricing correct when launching a new vehicle.<br>
  If a manufacturer misses the mark on price and over-prices its model, it is very likely that sales will suffer. On the other hand, if the prices are to low, the company can miss out on potential profit margins. Hence it is a must that the right note is hit with the pricing.<br></p>
<p>In this project I use an available data set of over 1200 car models in the Indian Industry in the year 2020 and perform an in-depth analysis from business analytics, using EDA to get an insight on how differnt factors weigh in on Price and some competition analysis, to a full blown Linear Regression model to predict the price of a new model with an accuracy of just under 90% on the test set.<br>
  There are ofcourse a lot of different techniques which can improve our perspective on the Pricing and I suggest one such classification technique as a means of further improvement towards the end of the Project.<br>
  Hope the readers enjoy my research and find it interesting.</p>
